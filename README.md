# Exploring notReact

This repo is an exploratory work on how a minimal version of React, `not-react`, having ~200 bytes, can success in implementing the basic behavior of React. It is so minimal that only accepts pure functional not-react components.

So far, so good! Check out the examples :)

## TODO

Add examples for [List and Keys](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html) and the next topics in the React Quick Start.
